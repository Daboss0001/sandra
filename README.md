# Sandra Discord Bot
Sandra is a powerful multi-purpose Discord bot focused on form and function.

Historically this project has been closed-source on GitLab, but in light of Discord's new
[Developer Verification Program](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040720412)
I have opted to open-source the bot and continue development on GitHub to be more transparent.

With this I will also be rewriting the bot from the ground up using Kotlin to ensure we are maximizing
Discord's features and addressing any privacy concerns that may arise. (And to keep very old commits to myself...)

Feel free to join our [support server](https://sandrabot.com/support) if you have any questions.

**Self hosting is not, and will not, be supported.**
